## üîß Extension Workflow Overview

Understanding how **BLURit** works under the hood can help you appreciate the privacy-first design and efficient performance.

The core of any browser extension is the `manifest.json` file ‚Äî it serves as the configuration blueprint. Here's a breakdown of how everything fits together:

- The `manifest.json` file defines essential metadata like extension name, version, permissions, and background scripts.
- When the user activates the extension, a `content.js` script is injected into the webpage to apply dynamic styles such as blur and spotlight effects.
- The popup interface interacts with the extension‚Äôs background processes to read and update user settings in real-time.
- All the customization settings (like blur level, spotlight toggle, etc.) are stored using `chrome.storage`, making them persistent across sessions.
- The entire extension is isolated from the page content, ensuring security and performance.
